## About
This is a Xposed Module. I wrote it for my own purpose.
Swipe left-right to seek, swipe up-down to change volume in youtube video player. Changing volume only works if you're in full screen mode.
## How to install
1. Install [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer).
2. Install this module from [Xposed Module Repository](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.blueberry.youtubeswipetoseek).
